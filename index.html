            <h2 class="h2">Who is the founder?</h2>
            <p>Richard E. Mayer has a PhD in psychology and is a current professor of psychology at the University of California. His research areas include cognition, perception, and cognitive neuroscience. Some of his works are related to cognition, instruction, and technology, with the goal of determining how people learn and how to help people learn.
            <p></p>In particular, Mayer came up with the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) in 2001, wherein it reveals that people learn more effectively from words and graphics than from words alone. This theory is the foundation for effective and efficient instructional design.</p>

            <h2>How does CTML improve instructional designs?</h2>
            <p>Instructional designs are the materials that are purposefully curated to keep the learners engaged in the discussion of the topic. Meanwhile, CTML is based on three assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Active Processing:</b> Materials are effective in the development of learners if they are actively engaged in processing the information and not just passively receiving it.</li>
                <li><b>Dual-Channel Processing:</b> There are two separate channels for processing two different types of information: graphics/visual information and auditory/textual information.</li>
                <li><b>Limited Capacity:</b> Humans can only process a limited amount of information at a time; hence, materials should avoid content overload.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these assumptions from CTML, Mayer derived the 12 principles of multimedia learning to enhance and optimize instructional designs.</p>

            <h3>Multimedia Principle</h2>
            <p class="quote"><i>“People learn better from words and pictures than from words alone”- Mayer.</i></p>
            <p>Instructional designs should not be limited to using only one channel but should integrate different channels. Presenting information in multiple formats helps learners engage and grasp the idea effectively.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid unnecessary incorporation of different formats for the sake of it.</li>
                <li>Make sure to use the best medium when presenting certain information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sec1">
        <h3>Coherence Principle</h3>
        <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when extraneous material is excluded rather than included”- Mayer </i></p>
        <p>The content of the learning materials should be concise and exclude extraneous information to avoid information overload that leads to learner burnout.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid background music.</li>
            <li>Include visuals or text that directly support the objectives of the topic.</li>
            <li>Maximize the use of diagrams and infographics.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

    </main>

    <main class="main3">
        <section class="sec1">
            <h3>Signalling Principle</h3>
            <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when cues are added that highlight the organization of essential material”- Mayer</i></p>
            <p>Key points or cues are vital in managing the cognitive load of the learning process. Identifying and highlighting important information is necessary to maximize memory retention and avoid cognitive overload.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasize important information using colors, arrows, callouts, or bold text.</li>
                <li>Improve the outline and content organization of the information.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="sec1">
            <h3>Redundancy Principle</h3>
            <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration, and on-screen text”- Mayer</i></p>
            <p>Presenting the same information in different formats is not a good representation of information and may easily overwhelm learners and exceed the limited capacity of the brain’s working memory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid using both graphics and text simultaneously in a narrated presentation.</li>
                <li>Minimize the on-screen text while narration is playing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </main>

    <main class="main3">
        <section class="sec1">
            <h3>Spatial Contiguity Principle</h3>
            <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when corresponding printed words and graphics are presented near rather than far from each other on the page or screen”- Mayer</i></p>
            <p>Learners learn more effectively when information is properly organized near its media counterparts to reduce cognitive load and enhance comprehension.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display instructions on the same page of the screen.</li>
                <li>Keep text near the graphics it describes for clear references.</li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Temporal Contiguity Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when corresponding graphics and narration are presented simultaneously rather than successively”- Mayer</i></p>
                <p>Simultaneous presentation of words and images is much more effective than learning them separately. When learners are presented with related pieces of information, it maximizes the time to organize and assess information at the same time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure voiceovers are timed with visual animation.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that text and graphics are on the same screen.</li>
                </ul>

        <main class="main3">

            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Segmenting Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply when a multimedia message is presented in learner-paced segments rather than as a continuous unit”- Mayer</i></p>
                <p>Breaking down complex information into smaller and manageable pieces helps learners completely absorb and understand the information, which avoids cognitive overload.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow learners to control the pace of learning the information.
                    </li>
                    <li>Manage the organization of lengthy information into digestible segments.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Pre-training Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when they have learned the names and characteristics of the main concepts”- Mayer</i></p>
                <p>Ensure learners have foundational knowledge on certain topics before diving into a more advanced lesson on the related topic. This ensures that learners are competent to understand advanced information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduce key concepts before discussing the main lessons.</li>
                    <li>Assess learners’ familiarity with the materials or tools.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </main>

        <main class="main3">
            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Modality Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when the words are spoken rather than printed”- Mayer</i></p>
                <P>Balanced use of different modalities shows that learners effectively learn from narration with visual or animated presentations rather than with only one modality. By using different modalities, complex concepts become easier to understand when the correct modality is used.</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider a diagram with adjacent text versus voice narration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cater to the learners’ preferred modalities.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Voice Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn better when the narration in multimedia lessons is spoken in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice”- Mayer </i></p>
                <p>Human socialization is part of the culture of humanity; hence, a friendly and engaging narration is much preferred over a robotic, mechanical sound when learning.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a human voice when recording a narration video.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </main>

        <main class="main3">
            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Personalization Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People learn better from multimedia lessons when words are in conversational style rather than formal style ”- Mayer</i></p>
                <p>Similar to the Voice Principle, an informal conversational style is more approachable and engaging than a formal one and brings motivation to the learners as it enhances the social presence between educator and learner.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use accessible, everyday language when discussing.</li>
                    <li>Be natural while still respectful.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="sec1">
                <h3>Image Principle</h3>
                <p class="quote"><i>“People do not necessarily learn more deeply from a multimedia message when the speaker’s image is visible on screen"- Mayer</i></p>
                <p>This principle suggests that the image or video of the educator while teaching is not an ideal setup. Only necessary and related images should be presented on the screen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider showing the speaker’s image or video at certain times with the purpose of building social trust only.</li>
                </ul>
